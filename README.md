# Skill-Learning
Chu Kochen academy's "practical skill Learning" and UCB's missing semester learning record.

On 2023.11.24, after finishing Latex, git, github and CASIO Learning, the spotlight is focused on the other practical skills, including shell, better texter such as vim, and docs.

Time to get start. Not you and me, this time it is just my trudge.

2023.11.27, finish Chu Kochen academy's "practical skill Learning". Time to move to UCB's class.
But it is far from racing to it. It is advisable if I learn CS60 series in advance.

If you have any advice, please feel free to tell me!
